            <br />Graphic of a newspaper showing a news report. The text for the report is: "The incident began shortly after noon when police, aided by a police chopper, gave chase to a GMC van as it left Detroit just one hour after a DHS red alert went into effect about an impending terror attack. The van contained 10 men, none of whom had any ID on them. The driver of the van ignored orders to stop and a high speed chase ensured. The police, their weapons drawn, were finally able to stop the van a take the occupants into custody. Initial charges against the driver included felony evasion."<br/><br/>
			There is a button at the bottom of this graphic that says <b>"Check Your Mindset"</b>. When you clicks on this button, a pop-up window opens with the following text being displayed:<br/><br/>
			"Depending on your mindset, you might see this as a:<br/><br/>			
              <ul>
			  <li>
			    <p>Criminal Offense</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>Nexus with Terrorism</p>
			  </li>
			  </ul>
			  Contacts like this occur every hour nationwide and depending on the officer’s mindset, he or she will either view it as a criminal issue or have a broader view of the potential terrorist connection.  It’s all in your mindset."<br/><br/>
