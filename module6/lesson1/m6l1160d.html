            <br />This animation shows a book with the title “Example of Differences in Mindsets”, which when flipped open displays the following text listed on its pages:
              <ul>
			  <li>
			    <p>Local Law Enforcement Mindset: The police analyst views intelligence from the perspective of interrupting crimes and making criminal cases for the detectives and prosecution. Of course, when the arrests are made, the stream of intelligence is disrupted.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>DHS Analyst Mindset: A DHS analyst may view the same intelligence strategically, using it to characterize a criminal organization, understand how it operates and predict its future behavior. This analyst may be much less interested in making a case and much more interested in having access to a continuous stream of valuable information.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <p>Conclusion: The two mindsets – law enforcement and “traditional” intelligence sometimes compete. This was acknowledged as a serious systemic national security problem by the 911 Commission.</p>
