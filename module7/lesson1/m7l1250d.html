<li><b>Highly Ambiguous Situations, A Catch-22:</b> In ambiguous situations, it is common for the thinker’s own perception to have a greater influence on perspective than in clearer situations, where it is easier to step and see alternatives. Intelligence analysts are almost always working with ambiguous situations, so they must be particularly careful not to let their own perception impact the “objective” analysis too much. <br><br></li>
<li><b>Information that is Processed Incrementally:</b> An analyst who starts observing a potential problem situation at an early and unclear stage is at a disadvantage because the mind holds onto that first impression longer. Policymakers, whose first exposure may come at a later stage when more and better info is available, may have an advantage in seeing the situation more clearly. Intel analysts also work in an environment where complete answers don’t exist, so they have to beware of creating patterns to explain things. They can be more objective when they are aware of how they process this incremental and incomplete information.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Pressure for Early Judgment:</b> The system requires the intel analyst to come up with an almost instant diagnosis before sufficient hard information and broader background is available to gain perspective. Once new information is available, the evidence might suggest a different explanation. But as we’ve discussed, an early judgment adversely affects the formation of future perceptions. Once an observer thinks he or she knows what is happening, this perception is resist to change.<br><br></li>
