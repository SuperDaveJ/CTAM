        <br />The brain is designed above all to be efficient. It is often accurate as well, but its first and foremost priority is to be efficient.<br><br>Let’s look at this priority by looking at a simple issue we all face from time to time: misplacing the car keys. Let’s compare what you do to find them to what a computer would do.<br><br><b>The Human Brain:</B><br /><br />You check the counter, the table by the door, your coat pocket, back to the counter.  You tend to look quickly in places that make immediate sense, and only if you can’t find them that way do you get more methodical about your search.  Your brain is trying to solve the problem efficiently by doing it quickly.  We’ve all experienced the lapse in accuracy that this tendency can cause!<br><br><B>The Computer:</B><br /><br />The computer would start methodically in one place and walk step by step through the house without regard to where you had recently been or what you might have been doing.  Eventually, it would find the keys, but it would be tedious and might take a long time. If you functioned like this and were aware of every decision you made, you would never get anything done.</td>
