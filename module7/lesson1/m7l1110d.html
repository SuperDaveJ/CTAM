        Take a moment to get more familiar with the ways we construct our reality.<br>
        <br><B>Characteristic #1: Search for explanations and see patterns <br><br>Explanation</B><br />
        When looking at information you construct your own reality.  Your brain searches for explanation and sees patterns. As Morgan Jones wrote in <em>The Thinker’s Toolkit</em>, 1998, Three Rivers Press: “We feel the need to find explanations for everything, regardless of whether the explanations are accurate.” <br>
        <br>
<B>Example</B><br />Think of when you are looking at case evidence - where do you start? The mind is attracted to patterns, so the most logical starting point it to search for and create patterns.<br><br><B>Characteristic #2: Settle for the first solution that makes sense<br><br>Explanation</B><br />The term “satisfice” (a combination of “satisfy” and “suffice”) is used to describe the phenomenon of:<br><br>	<ul>		
	<li>Settling for the first solution that makes sense<br><br></li>
<li>Sticking with it<br></li></ul>Picking the first solution that makes intuitive sense is a good thing. You live in a world with incomplete data and it would be unnecessary, even dangerous, to stick around and find every last shred of evidence to absolutely prove something before taking action.<br><br><B>Example</B><br />
Imagine two officers are walking along a street in a high crime area. They hear footsteps and see a shadow on the building adjacent to them. The first officer runs for the nearest cover and prepares to defend himself, while and the second one takes a position where he can see evidence to make sure he is being threatened. If the footsteps and shadow turn out to be a dog, the one who stays behind is safe. If it was an attacking suspect, then the one who needed to find all the evidence gets hurt.<br><br><B>Characteristic #3: Unconsciously put stock in evidence that supports your beliefs and disregard evidence that does not<br><br>Explanation</B><br />We may think that we gather data and then make decisions, but all too often, we do that in reverse. We make our decision and then look for the data that supports it.<br><br><B>Example</B><br />A popular marketing idea is, “You buy on emotion, then justify with facts.”  You decide you want a new flat screen TV and then find the facts to justify what you have already decided.<br><br><B>Characteristic #4: You perceive what you expect to perceive<br><br>Explanation</B><br />
What we think we are viewing objectively often has a very subjective slant to it because we perceive what we want to perceive and tune out the rest.<br><br><B>Example</B><br />
How many of you have turned in reports only to later find spelling and other mistakes? What’s worse is that you knew that you proofread that paper multiple times and checked every word! Actually, you read what you <em>thought</em> you had written or <em>wanted</em> to have written, and did not read the exact words on the page.</td>
