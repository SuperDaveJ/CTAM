        <br />You constantly deal with a blizzard of information and continually make decisions, most of which happen below your level of consciousness. Think about your morning routine. Which of these activities do you think would be done subconsciously?<ul>
<li>Deciding what to eat for breakfast<br><br></li>
<li>Using a spoon for your cereal<br><br></li>
<li>Pouring the milk into a bowl<br><br></li>
<li>Bringing the spoon to your mouth</li>
                </ul>
        Deciding what to eat for breakfast is probably something you do consciously—thinking about what you have in stock, making a list of alternatives in your mind, and determining which alternative sounds the most appealing.<br>
    <br>Using a spoon for your cereal may be something you do subconsciously. Probably you just grab a spoon without thinking too much about it. This response is a habit based on years of eating cereal.<br><br>Pouring the milk may be something you do subconsciously. Probably you just grab the milk without thinking too much about it, unless you’re wondering if you even have milk. In that case, you might consciously have to think about what you could use instead or if you have time to run to the store.<br><br>Bringing the spoon to your mouth is probably something you do without thinking about it consciously. You may even be doing something else, like reading the newspaper.<br><br>If you had to consciously make decisions like this everyday, you would be exhausted by the end of breakfast and you would need to spend time figuring out how to crawl back into bed!</td>
