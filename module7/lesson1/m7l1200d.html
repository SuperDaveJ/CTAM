        <br />For instance, you drive, and sometimes don’t pay enough attention to the road, which can be a life-changing!<ul>
<li>Look at all the things we do to distract ourselves from paying attention to the road. We assume that the brain can handle all these tasks without skipping a beat. Our brain switches to automatic pilot and that works for us.<br><br></li>
<li>Have you been driving and then realized that for the previous length of time, you weren’t really paying attention? You can’t remember what you had been doing for any length of time. For example, a song was playing and you heard it start, but never heard it end. </li>
