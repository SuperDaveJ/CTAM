                <br />The image shows a step graphic, with the following information being displayed upon selecting each step.<ol>
<li>Review the current analytic line; write it down. Without the written words, it is easy to assume everyone understands the same thing. The process of writing it down ensures its clarity.<br><br></li>
<li>Articulate all ideas, both stated and unstated.  Again, writing these down can help ensure they are clearly understood.<br>
  <br></li>
<li>Challenge each assumption. Ask questions about its validity.<br><br></li><ul>
<li>Must it always be true?<br><br></li>
<li>Under what conditions might it not be true?<br><br></li>
<li>Could it have been true in the past but no longer be true today?<br><br></li><li>If it turned out to be wrong, how much impact would that have on analytic line?<br><br></li></ul>
<li>Refine the list of key assumptions. Delete the key assumptions that do not hold up under questioning.  Add new key assumptions that have been identified.<br><br></li><ul>
<li>The format used in the 2002 Sniper Case example provides a clear way of presenting the assumptions and your assessment of each.  As you refine the list of assumptions in the final step, assumptions which are no longer recognized as “must be true” should be removed from the chart.<br><br></li>
<li>If you are using this analytic method to analyze competing hypotheses, key assumptions for each should be identified and challenged. Through this process, you will need to refine your set of hypotheses—eliminating, changing, or adding hypotheses as appropriate.</li></ul>
