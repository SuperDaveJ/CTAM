      This animation shows a book with the title “Lessons Learned – 2002 Sniper Case.” When you open the pages of the book, the following text is displayed:
      <ul>
<li><b>Avoid jumping to conclusions</b> that did not hold up under closer scrutiny. These included assuming that the sniper is:<br><br></li><ol>
<li>White<br><br></li>
<li>Has military training, and<br><br></li>
<li>Is driving a white van<br><br>By explicitly examining each assumption, officials could have avoided prematurely narrowing down the potential pool of suspects to a group that did not include the actual perpetrator. Similarly, they might have been more cautious about accepting that the sniper was driving a white van.<br><br></li></ol>
<li><b>Be receptive to new leads and citizen tips</b>, such as eyewitness reports that the sniper fled the scene driving a specific model Chevrolet.<br><br></li>
<li><b>More seriously consider evidence that subsequently became available, which contradicted a key assumption. If officials had stated explicitly that they were assuming the sniper was acting alone, they might have been sensitive to new information that contradicted that key assumption.</b> Often this type of information gets "lost in the noise" if the analyst has not already thought about what key assumptions he or she is making.</li>
