      This animation shows a book with the title “2002 sniper Case - Key Assumptions Analytic Method”. When you open the pages of the book, the following text is displayed:<br />
    <br />Do you remember the outbreak of sniper shootings in the Washington, DC area in the fall of 2002? This case has since been used in numerous trainings as an example of what can go wrong when you don’t consider key assumptions in your analysis.<br><br>After an initial flurry of shootings, the operating assumption that quickly emerged was that the shootings were the work of a single, white male who had some military training and was driving a white van. When the case was broken, police took into custody two African-American males who were shooting from the trunk of a car.<br><br>If law enforcement officials had conducted a Key Assumptions check, might they have come up with a different initial description? Read this table to learn more.</td>

        Possible because you have a credible eyewitness account but worthy of continuing scrutiny given the number of white vans in the area (more than 70,000 registered in the Maryland suburbs of Metropolitan Washington, DC) and that different kinds of vehicles are being described.<br></td>
