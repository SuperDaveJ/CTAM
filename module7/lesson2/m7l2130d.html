      The graphic initially shows a notepad with a list of bulleted items and having a heading titled “KEY ASSUMPTIONS”. When it is selected, the following text is overlaid on top of the graphic:<br>
    <br>Commuters were suddenly told to get off the train at the Kodenmacho station. At first, subway officials said there was an explosion at the station ahead.  While waiting on the platform, three people collapsed.  Commuters went up to the sidewalk and saw people vomiting and falling down on the steps.  Many were crying and calling out for help.  Many complained of headaches and narrowed vision.</td>
