          Review the following data set:<br><br>
Data set #1:  Customs and Border Protection Officers contacted the driver of a vehicle parked  near CBP regional headquarters in Chula    Vista CA where he was  seen taking photographs of the complex. The driver had no criminal history and  told officers he was an architecture student looking at buildings in the area  for a project.<Br><Br>Data set #2:  A foreign national crossing at San Ysidro Port of Entry was in possession of  aerial photographs of the CBP heliport at Brown Field. He told CBP agents he  was a helicopter buff and wanted photos for his scrapbook.<br><br>Data  set #3: A U.S. Coast Guard port security team based in San   Diego Bay stopped a  recreational vessel for operating without the required equipment off from  waters south of San Diego.  When questioned, the boat&rsquo;s occupants said they were out for a pleasure cruise.  In their possession were green uniform pants and shirts lacking any identifying  patches or badges. Occupants told agents the uniforms were to be used in an  upcoming costume party. None of the occupants had ID on them.</td>
