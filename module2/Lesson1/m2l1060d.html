		A watermark of an open book with spiral binding appears on the page. The following text appears on the left page of the book:<br>
“In his book <em>Critical Thinking and Intelligence Analysis</em>, David T. Moore (<u>bio</u>) writes:<br><br>
“In the context of intelligence analysis, critical thinking becomes one of the most&mdash;if not the most&mdash;important skills of the analyst. Facing symmetric and asymmetric threats, analysts have a potent and powerful tool to facilitate their asking the right questions in the process of improving their understanding of the problem at hand as well as their own reasoning about the problem.”<br>
<br>The following text appears on the right page of the book:<br><br>
“As an analyst, your most important skill is an ability to think critically and communicate your thinking clearly. So it is important to think about thinking to ensure you are maintaining, even enhancing, that skill-set.”<br><br>
