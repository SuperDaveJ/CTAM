		A book with the title “<strong>Critical Thinking: An Introduction</strong>” is displayed on the screen. After the book is opened, the following text displays on the left page:<br>
		<br>“Active, persistent, and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds which support it and the further conclusion to which it tends.<br><br>- Alex Fisher, Critical Thinking: An Introduction, Cambridge Press, 2001.”<br><br>
		Definitions of the following words or phrases are displayed on the right page:<br><br>
		<strong>“Active”:</strong> This is in contrast to a passive process, in which you just receive ideas and information from someone else. The active process involves thinking things through, raising questions, and finding relevant information.<br><br>
		<strong>“Persistent and careful”:</strong> This is in contrast to unreflective thinking, in which you jump to a conclusion or make a snap judgment.<br><br>
		<strong>“Grounds which support further conclusions to which it tends”:</strong> What matters are the reasons we have for believing something and the implications of our beliefs!
