As Jeffrey White states, “Intelligence analysis is often the ‘art’ of credible prediction on the basis of all too incomplete evidence.”<br><br>According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of <em>The Tipping Point, Blink</em>, or <em>Outliers</em>, people make a lot of decisions in the first two seconds of a situation.<br><br>Often times, we are not consciously aware that we are making the decisions, yet they can be pretty accurate.<br><br>An example is when you meet someone for the first time, walk into a house you are thinking of buying, or read the first few sentences of a book. Your mind takes about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions.<br><br>Saying that critical thinking is an art is about trying to understand <strong>how</strong> we make decisions. Sometimes, we use our gut reaction; sometimes we study a topic for years. Usually it’s a combination of both. The art is in knowing which to use in any given situation.<Br><Br>

<strong>Right graphic: Microscope with the text label “Science”:</strong>
Thinking critically is purposeful, methodologically sound thinking. Scientists would never think of publishing their work without showing all aspects of the work, the evidence, methodology, assumptions and such. Neither should intelligence analysts.<Br><Br>Instead, good analysts apply a scientific approach in which they:
			<ul>
				<li>
				  <p>Sort evidence</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <p>Judge credibility and evidence</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <p>Make assumptions and reasoning explicit</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <p>Evaluate evidence</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
