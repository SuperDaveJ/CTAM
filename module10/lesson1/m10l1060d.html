            <br />The graphic initially shows nine dots in a three X three grid. When it is selected, the following changes take place in the original graphic:<br/><br/>
       A line appears to the left and below the lowest left dot on the grid and moves diagonally up to the upper right dot, then the line extends through the two dots to the left and slightly beyond the uppermost left dot, and then moves down diagonally through the center dots to below the lowest right dot, and finally up the right side to connect with the upper right dot. As each line is drawn, it is numbered, "1", "2", "3", and "4". After the dots are connected, the following text appears in a box at the bottom of the graphic:<br/><br/>
       "The hidden rule in this puzzle is that many people assume an imaginary square drawn around the dots.  They assume they need to keep their four lines within this box.  Thinking "outside the box", is the only way the puzzle can be solved.  The puzzles can’t be solved if you define the problem too narrowly."</span></td>
