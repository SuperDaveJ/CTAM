        <br />Ordering the hypotheses by the number of "Inconsistencies" gives you a rough ranking of their probability (least number of inconsistencies is probably the most likely). This is probably the most non-intuitive step in the process. Our minds like to rank things based on consistency, not inconsistency—so this strikes many of us as a bit odd.<br/><br/> 
In "A Consoling Word About Consistent Evidence", Morgan Jones recognizes this tension, and reminds us that "inconsistent evidence plays the key role during the analytic phase while consistent evidence plays the key role in the summation and presentation phase."<br/><br/>
ACH Matrix Table of 4 columns titled Hypothesis 1 through 4 on top and 5 rows on left titled Evidence and Total. In the evidence rows, evidence is listed: E1 Trucks are rarely recovered, E2 Cars are often recovered in northern CA cities, E3 Arrested suspects are most frequently local teens and E4 Stolen vehicles make and models are normally available for sale in Mexico. In this matrix, weights are added and table includes these weights:<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>E1 Trucks are rarely recovered and H1 vehicles are stolen for use in Mexico: +1</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>E1 Trucks are rarely recovered and H2 vehicles are stolen for joyriding by locals: 0</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>E1 Trucks are rarely recovered and H3 vehicles are stolen for transportation northbound: 0</p>
