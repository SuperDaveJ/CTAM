            <br />As a general rule, working memory can hold seven distinct pieces at a time, plus or minus two.  But consider for a moment how complicated analysis can get, and how that complexity might easily outstrip an analysts working memory. Notice how complexity increases geometrically as the number of variables in an analytical problem.<br/><br/>
            <ul>
            <li>
              <p>When a problem has just 4 variables, there are 6 possible interrelationships between variables</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>With 5 variables, there are 10 possible interrelationships between variables</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>With 6 variables, there are 15 possible interrelationships between variables</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>With 8 variables, there are 28 possible interrelationships between variables</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            &quot;The evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses is not easy because of these limits to working memory.  It turns out to be much easier to list evidence that supports a favorite hypothesis, which is why people so often resort to satisficing.<br/>
            <br/> 
So what can we do about the problem of working memory and how its limitations can lead to ineffective analysis?  That’s where ACH can help."<br>- Heuer, <em>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</em>, 1999</span></td>
