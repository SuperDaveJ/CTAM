        <br />Focus on disproving hypotheses rather than proving one. Tally the pieces of evidence that are inconsistent and consistent with each hypothesis to see which explanations are the weakest and strongest. People have a natural tendency to concentrate on confirming hypotheses they already believe to be true, and they commonly give more weight to information that supports a hypothesis than to information that weakens it. Step five turns that thinking around.<br/><br/>
Work <strong>down</strong> the columns now, looking at each hypothesis as a whole. By looking at the evidence and diagnostic information in this matrix, the hypotheses can compete for your favor on equal ground.<br/>
<br/>
When the ACH matrix icon is selected, an ACH Matrix Table of 4 columns titled Hypothesis 1 through 4 on top and 5 rows on left titled Evidence and Total is displayed. Hypotheses are added to the hypotheses columns: H1 vehicles are stolen for use in Mexico, H2 vehicles are stolen for joyriding by locals, H3 vehicles are stolen for transportation northbound. In the evidence rows, evidence is listed: E1 Trucks are rarely recovered, E2 Cars are often recovered in northern CA cities, E3 Arrested suspects are most frequently local teens, and E4 Stolen vehicles make and models are normally available for sale in Mexico. A large arrow points down first hypothesis column.
