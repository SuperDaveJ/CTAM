        <br />Generating these hypotheses is the first step in the process. Remember to:<br/><br/>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use a group of analysts with different perspectives to brainstorm the possibilities </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make a clear distinction between the hypothesis generation and hypothesis evaluation stages </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Don’t begin a hypothesis with "I think"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be clear and concise</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        What do you do with them after you have generated them? Let’s look at a case study and develop some hypotheses by selecting the icon on the right.<br/><br/>
        Case Study<br/><br/>
The City of Chula Vista, a midsize city located on the border with Mexico, is experiencing a serious spike in auto thefts.  Arrests of suspects suggest the thefts might be related to the city’s proximity to Mexico or other unrelated reasons.  The police department wants too identify the likely reason for the increase so it can develop an effective auto theft prevention strategy.  Hypothesis list appears: Hypotheses are added: H1 vehicles are stolen for use in Mexico, H2 vehicles are stolen for joyriding by locals, H3 vehicles are stolen for transportation northbound.</td>
