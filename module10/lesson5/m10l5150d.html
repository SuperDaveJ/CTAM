        <br />The matrix shouldn’t dictate any conclusions to you, but should reflect your judgment about what is most likely.  When you have completed it, perform a sanity check. Ask yourself:<br/><br/>
<ul><li>
  <p>Do you agree with the conclusions that matrix is suggesting?  If not, why?</p>
</li>  
<li>
  <p>Is there evidence missing from the matrix that is important in your conclusion?</p>
</li>  
<li>
  <p>Do other perspectives outweigh what the matrix is saying?</p>
</li>
</ul>
You are not obligated to follow the conclusions of the matrix. But when you are done, it will serve as a shorthand record of your thinking and as an audit trail showing how you arrived at your conclusions.<br/><br/> 
In this matrix, weights are added and table includes these weights.<br/><br/>
