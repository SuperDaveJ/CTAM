        <br />Testing consistency is the most important element of this analytical procedure. But because this step differs most from the natural, intuitive approach to analysis, it is the step you are most likely to overlook or misunderstand.<br/><br/>
Let’s take one piece of evidence. Ask yourself it it’s consistent with, inconsistent with, or irrelevant to each hypothesis.  Working across the row, make a notation accordingly under each hypothesis. Keep in mind if you go down, you are only considering one hypothesis, but if you go across, you consider all the hypotheses in relation to the same evidence.<br/><br/> 
This format is different from other types of analysis, in that evidence has no diagnostic value if it is equally consistent with all hypotheses. It doesn’t provide much help in deciding which hypothesis is more or less likely than another.<br/><br/> 
When the ACH matrix icon is selected, an ACH Matrix Table of 4 columns titled Hypothesis 1 through 4 on top and 5 rows on left titled Evidence and Total is displayed. Hypotheses are added to the hypotheses columns: H1 vehicles are stolen for use in Mexico, H2 vehicles are stolen for joyriding by locals, H3 vehicles are stolen for transportation northbound. In the evidence rows, evidence is listed: E1 Trucks are rarely recovered, E2 Cars are often recovered in northern CA cities, E3 Arrested suspects are most frequently local teens, and E4 Stolen vehicles make and models are normally available for sale in Mexico. A large arrow points across first row of evidence.
