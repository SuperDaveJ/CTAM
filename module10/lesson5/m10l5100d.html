        <br />ACH demands that after you explicitly identify all reasonable alternative hypotheses, you then array the evidence against each hypothesis, rather than evaluating the plausibility of each hypothesis one at a time. Just how do you decide what is significant?<br/><br/>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Think broadly; do not limit yourself to concrete evidence, but list all factors that impact your judgment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Include your own assumptions or logical deductions about people, groups or country's intentions, goals, or standard procedures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Include the absence of things you would expect to see if a hypothesis were true.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        We’ve added our evidence from the case study. Select the icon on the right to view the ACH matrix. When selected, an ACH Matrix Table of 4 columns titled Hypothesis 1 through 4 on top and 5 rows on left titled Evidence and Total is displayed. In the evidence rows, evidence is listed: E1 Trucks are rarely recovered, E2 Cars are often recovered in northern CA cities, E3 Arrested suspects are most frequently local teens and E4 Stolen vehicles make and models are normally available for sale in Mexico.
