    <br>
    <p>Here are some of the ways that ingrained rules can limit your thinking. As you review them, consider which ones cause the most problems for you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>      Mindsets</strong><br>
      <br>
      If you stay in your typical mindset and normal perception patterns, you will automatically put parts together in familiar ways. Creative thinking is about seeing something new and putting pieces together in unique and novel combinations.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>      Cultural Frameworks</strong><br>
      <br>
      The organizational and identity groups you put yourself, and others in, create frameworks for us to make sense of the world. A potential downside is that you may not be able to think outside of the framework.<br>
      <br>
      For example, thinking of terrorists as evil and two-dimensional may interfere with realizing how clever and creative they can be in planning attacks.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>      Mirror Imaging</strong><br>
      <br>
      Mirror imaging is the tendency to inject our own culture, goals, and experiences onto:
    <ul>
	<li><p>Our understanding of our adversaries&rsquo; goals and behavior</p></li>
    <li><p>Our own vulnerabilities</p></li></ul>
    <p>Mirror-imaging assumes that the other side is likely to act in a certain way because that is how the U.S. would act under similar circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>      The Golden Rule</strong><br>
      <br>      
      For intelligence analysis, following the Golden Rule can lead to crucial mistakes in analyzing behavior.  Instead, it should be abandoned for what some call the Platinum Rule. <br>
      <br>
      This can help focus you on broadening your thinking to account for the differences in your own mindsets and others.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>      Good Taste</strong><br>
      <br>      
      We are all raised with rules of etiquette and what our culture considers &ldquo;good taste.&rdquo; But especially as you analyze and consider terrorist tactics, you may have to abandon your sense of good taste and consider frightening options.<br>
      <br>
    Learning to challenge the rules yourself means understanding that your adversary may be willing to challenge the rules beyond good taste. </p>
