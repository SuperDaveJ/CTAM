      <p>As you begin to apply the creative thinking skills you&rsquo;ve just learned, consider some best practices that other analysts have found useful by selecting each graphic to listen to the analysts. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Be open to creative (&ldquo;crazy&rdquo;) thoughts</strong><br>
        <br>
        Sometimes creative thoughts sound crazy at first, and it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss them without consideration.  But I&rsquo;ve found that if I stay open to the &ldquo;craziness&rdquo;, at least for a little while, it usually pays off.<br>
        <br>
        Also, I&rsquo;ve learned to be open to other ideas, even the earliest or roughest ideas. That kind of openness means a whole lot more ideas up for consideration. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Recognize the frailty of new ideas</strong><br>
        <br>
        A new idea is frail and needs to be nurtured and developed before being exposed to the harsh reality of public criticism.<br>
        <br>
        I share my partially developed ideas and get feedback, without fear of criticism or ridicule. Ideas are worked through the whole creative process.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Develop fortitude</strong><br>
        <br>
        Generating and developing new ideas takes a certain amount of fortitude. From 100 good ideas comes one idea that works. You have to be prepared that many, if not most, ideas will not be accepted.  And even the ones that are eventually accepted probably won&rsquo;t be at first. <br>
        <br>
        You have to develop a thick skin and not take it personally.  After all, this is the art, as opposed to the science, of intelligence analysis.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Embrace Change</strong><br>
        <br>
        Do you know what the definition of insanity is? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Think about it. How many times do we try the same technique that doesn&rsquo;t work and hope that this time, things will be different.<br>
        <br>
        This is obviously not an effective way to work.  In a field where the information is changing daily, we need to embrace the changes that creative thinking introduces.<br>
