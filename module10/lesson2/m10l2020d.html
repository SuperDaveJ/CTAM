    <br>
    Vertical thinking focuses on a specific area, and goes deep. It is purpose driven.<br>
    <br>
    Intelligence analysts are often trained in this kind of thinking because it is structured and it helps mitigate mistakes through cognitive errors or too much reliance on specific mindsets.  This is good! <br>
    <br>
    Take a moment to review the structure of vertical thinking.<br>
    <br>
    Vertical thinking is very logical and structured thinking, where all the steps build sequentially on the other.  You start with an idea and dig down deeper to come to final conclusions.  Or you start with an idea and build up new layers to a solution.<br>
    <br>
    Vertical thinking is deep and rich with texture and details. It's hard to forget with all that detail.  This is why vertical thinking is also referred to as critical thinking.</td>
