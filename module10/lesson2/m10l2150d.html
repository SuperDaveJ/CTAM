      <p>In February, 2008, Al Qaeda used two women from a psychiatric unit as suicide bombers. There were initial reports that they had Down Syndrome, although more recent thinking is that they suffered from depression and schizophrenia.<br>
        <br>
        What&rsquo;s your first reaction to this account? <br>
        <br>        
        <strong>Do you think that Al Qaeda has sunk to new lows?</strong><br>
        <br>        
        Westerners might think that Al Qaeda sunk to even new lows by using people who might not have been aware of what they were doing. In our cultural framework, this is in very bad taste. But could you look at it another way?<br>
        <strong><br>
        Or do you think that Al Qaeda may have used an effective technique?</strong><br>
        <br>
        If you put aside your own standards of good taste and think about what Al Qaeda was trying to accomplish, you may have to admit that they were clever. Maybe the guard at the checkpoint lowered his weapon because of the woman&rsquo;s appearance? Whatever it was, the technique was effective in allowing these suicide bombers to get closer to their target than other types of suicide bombers.<br>
