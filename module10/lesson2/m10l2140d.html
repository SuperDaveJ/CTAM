      <p><strong>How to Challenge the Rules</strong><br>
      <br>
      Let&rsquo;s try challenging some rules to see how doing so can change your thinking. <br>
      <br>
      Remember the Connect the Dots activity from lesson 1 of this module.  The objective is to draw a line through the series of dots. <br>
      <br>
      Let&rsquo;s see what happens when you challenge these two rules. <br>
      <strong><br>
      Rule #1: Lines must pass through the center dots</strong><br>
      <br>
      A common, unconscious constraint is the &ldquo;rule&rdquo; that the lines must pass through the center of the dots.  This constraint exists only in the mind of the problem solver, not in the definition of the problem.  If you challenge this rule, another solution becomes obvious.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Rule #2: Puzzle must be solved in 2-D</strong><br>
      <br>
      A subtle and pervasive mental block is the &ldquo;rule&rdquo; that the puzzle must be solved within a two-dimensional plane. By challenging that rule, you realize it may be possible to roll the paper to form a cylinder in such a way that you can draw a single straight line that spirals through all nine dots.<br>
