    <br>
    So, how do you do creative thinking? It&rsquo;s not an easy.<br>
    <br>
    As Linus Pauling indicates, generating a lot of ideas is a good start.<br>
    <br>
    Here are three other suggested strategies for stimulating creative thought.<br>
    <br>
    Take a moment to learn more about each one. Then we&rsquo;ll look at some examples.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Challenge the Rules:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Our thinking is often governed by rules that limit us to the familiar patterns we have already formed in our minds.  The rules are sometimes so ingrained that they are hidden from view, so we don&rsquo;t realize they are limiting our thought.<br>
    <br>
    This strategy involves identifying those &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, hidden or not, and challenging them.  By developing challenges for the rules, we put a block in the main track of our thought, which allows us to back up and see alternatives we might have otherwise ignored.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Shift Focus:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Shifting focus is a way to get your mind off the main track and onto a side track. You simply change the focus of your attention to force yourself to see new perspectives.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Connecting Different Ideas</strong><br>
    <br>
    Connecting different ideas involves bringing previously unrelated information and ideas together in meaningful ways.<br>
    <br>
    In this case, the goal is to get onto the side track from a completely different place.  Rather than starting from the main track and trying to change perspectives, this strategy is about jumping onto a side path before the pattern of the main track is too strong.</td>
