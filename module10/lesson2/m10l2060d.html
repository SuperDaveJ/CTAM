    <br>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s another example: <br>
      <br>
      Police in a major U.S. city were continuously called to a park to intervene with unruly adolescents.  The juveniles spent their days hanging out on the concrete pad around a large fountain in the center of the park, drinking, smoking and harassing office workers walking by.<br>
      <br>
      The traditional vertical solution would be to use the applicable local ordinance to cite juveniles when possible &ndash; hoping the enforcement action would convince them to leave.<br>
      <br>
      Think about it laterally. What might be a solution other than the obvious vertical solution?<br>
      <br>
      Compare your solution with what the police did:<br>
      Observant officers noticed the fountain would occasionally splash onto the concrete pad, leading the juveniles to slightly alter where they sat. Officers had the Parks Department overflow the fountain, completely wetting the pad.  The juveniles could no longer sit there and remain dry, so they moved!  The great thing about this approach was it was free, low conflict, and used no staff time.</p>
