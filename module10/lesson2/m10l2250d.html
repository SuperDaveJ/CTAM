      <p>The animation shows photo of analyst reviewing data, overlaid with the text: &ldquo;Should all persons who are suspected of being terrorists be publicly identified?&rdquo;<br>
                Around this image are the following buttons: doctor, teacher, businessman, and artist. When learner selects each button, the selected individual&rsquo;s inputs are displayed over top of the center graphic.<br>
        <br>
        Responses:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> As a doctor, we are guided by the Hippocratic Oath and treat everyone, regardless of their beliefs or activities. However, if we are to identify these people publicly, we are able to employ new technology and inject tracking electronics subdermally so that they can be tracked and identified by enforcement officials.</p>
        </li>
		<li>
		  <p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Sometimes, public identification is a good thing. After all, when we take kids on field trips, we require them to wear the same type of shirts so we can quickly and easily identify them in a crowd.  This might be a good thing so that we can easily see who these people are.</p>
		</li>
        <li><strong>Businessman:</strong> Identifying suspected terrorists is a good thing because it keeps our homes and livelihood safe.  We now have all kinds of barcodes attached to products we sell and buy-why not do the same to identify terrorists?</li>
      </ul>
	  <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Symbols are a quick and powerful means of conveying a meaning. We can apply this to terrorist identification.  However, we must be careful in doing this.  The danger of mistaking someone who is NOT a terrorist is high.</p>
