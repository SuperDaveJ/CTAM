    <br>
    <p>As an analyst, you&rsquo;ll use creative thinking to help you broaden your perspective on the data and to help avoid cognitive errors. Let&rsquo;s see how these analysts are using creative thinking. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Generate Ideas</strong><br>
      This analyst is at the beginning of his intelligence project, and is using creative thinking to generate hypotheses. Remember the Brainstorm Analytical method? He&rsquo;s using that to generate as many ideas as possible.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Stuck</strong><br>
      This analyst has been working on her project for a while and feels stuck. She doesn&rsquo;t really have any clear findings and no new ideas to get her going again. Creative thinking could help her get unstuck.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Overconfident</strong><br>
      This analyst has a lot of data and feels very confident in his findings. However, his conclusions seem too predictable. He knows that overconfidence is a cognitive error that could lead him to ignore potential alternatives and meaningful evidence. So,he&rsquo;s going to do some creative thinking to test his current conclusions.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Closed to New Ideas</strong><br>
      The people in this group are not listening to each other&rsquo;s perspectives. Each person feels very uncomfortable with some of the ideas that others are proposing. Creative thinking can help them to listen and appreciate each other&rsquo;s perspectives.</p>
