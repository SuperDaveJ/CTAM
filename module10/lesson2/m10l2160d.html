      </strong>
      <p>Shifting focus is another good strategy for stimulating  creative thought. Take a look at some ways that you can shift your focus. Then  we&rsquo;ll try some examples.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Humor</strong><br>
        <br>
      Jokes  often shift the focus of information. The punch line offers a completely new perspective that makes you think  differently than what you had thought all along.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Deliberate Provocation</strong><br>
      <br>
      De Bono suggests shifting focus by creating deliberate  provocations that are so strange that you just can&rsquo;t accept them. This provokes  your mind into reconsidering the generally accepted.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Thinking Backwards</strong><br>
      <br>
      Richards J. Heuer recommends training yourself to think backwards.<br>
      <br>
      Consider  an event that you think is unlikely to happen, and put yourself into a future  where it has happened. Then think  backwards about what must have happened in the past to have set the state for  the event. What actions did people take  in preparation for the event? <br>
      <br>
      Thinking  this way can help open new avenues for current research and may identify  current gaps in your intelligence that need to be filled. This can be particularly helpful for events  that have a low probability but very serious consequences should they occur.  Not being able to imagine something makes people think it is less likely to  occur. Therefore, it is important to imagine as many scenarios as <br>
      possible&mdash;even  unlikely ones.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Crystal Ball</strong><br>
      <br>
      Richards J. Heuer recommends the Crystal Ball method to get a  unique perspective on an analytic line of reasoning and to force yourself to  think about a side track that you might have missed in your initial analysis.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine that a perfect intelligence source (a  &ldquo;crystal ball) has told you that a certain assumption is wrong.&nbsp; Now develop a scenario to explain how the  crystal ball could be right. If you can  do this, it would suggest that your assumption is open to question.<br>
