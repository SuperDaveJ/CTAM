    The animation shows two selectable graphics. When each of these graphics is selected, the following text is displayed:
	<ul>
	<li><p>Did you know that when you were in school, you were taught vertical thinking? In school, your curriculum moved you toward reaching a standard of knowledge in any given subject. You moved toward that goal throughout the school year, and you were tested along the way. This is a prime example that vertical thinkers always move usefully in some direction and must be correct at every step.</p></li>
	<li>
	  <p>A good example of vertical thinking is following the steps of a procedure or process to reach your conclusion.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
