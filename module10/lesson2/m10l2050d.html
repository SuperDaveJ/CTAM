          Let&rsquo;s look at one example of creative, or lateral, thinking to see how it illustrates the concept. <br>
      <br>
      Hotel management at a large hotel had a problem&mdash;the elevators were too slow and customers continually complained. <br>
      <br>
      If you think about it vertically, there is an obvious solution.  Hire someone to improve the times or install new elevators!<br>
      <br>
      Think about it laterally&mdash;what might be a solution?<br>
      <br>
      Compare your solution with what the hotel did:
      <br>
      Rather than focusing on the elevators, they focused on the customers.  They installed large mirrors by the elevators so people were busy looking at themselves or glancing at others while they waited.  The distraction worked; customers stopped noticing the length of time and complaints decreased significantly.</td>
