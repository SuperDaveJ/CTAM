      <strong><br>
      </strong>
      <p>The last strategy for stimulating creative thought that we&rsquo;ll cover is connecting different ideas. Take a look at some ways that you can connect different ideas. Then we&rsquo;ll try some examples.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>        Cross Pollination</strong><br>
        <br>        
        Cross-pollination in creative thinking means carrying an existing idea from one area into a completely new area to form even better ideas. <br>
        <br>
        The trick is to try to explore worlds that may, at first glance, seem to have little relevance to the problems at hand.  Connecting these divergent ideas stimulates creating thinking.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>        Seek Alternative Methods</strong><br>
        <br>        
        Most people surround themselves with others who agree with them, since it is more comfortable to talk with people who share the same basic mindset.<br>
        <br>
        Instead seek out differing viewpoints:
      <ul><li><p>Talk to people who disagree with your ideas and listen to their input.</p></li>
		<li><p>Have your analytic reports read by non-group members who have not been immersed in the issue.</p></li>
        <li><p>Look to other disciplines for inspiration on your issues.</p></li>
      </ul>
	  <p><strong>Random Association
        </strong><br>
        <br>
      De Bono suggests finding a random word, picture or concept and thinking about how associations between the word and your issue.
      <br>
      <br>
    Don’t spend too much time trying to come up with the “perfect” random word, as that will send you back to your old ideas.  It’s easy to find words: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>From the dictionary</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>By flipping through a magazine and finding a picture</p>
        </li>
        <li>Looking around the office and choosing a piece of equipment</li>
      </ul>
