        <br />The outcome of the scam:<br/><br/>
        The scam was discovered nearly two years ago when a Queens Realtor opened a package meant for one of his employees and found 60 credit cards, the type "normally issued in anticipation of a customer’s card expiring," the police commissioner said. The NYPD traced those cards around the globe. During a 21-month investigation, cops used 80 phone taps to eavesdrop on more than 1 million calls, said the deputy chief, head of the special investigations division. Thirty-five suspects, mostly Nigerian immigrants in the city, were arrested and face charges of enterprise corruption, larceny and conspiracy."<br/>

        Some cultural and personal norms you could think of that might apply include:<br/><br/>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Nigerian criminals do not think that scams like these are wrong</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>They did not think they would get caught since they were not located in one country (diversified their locations)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There are multiple money and theft scams coming out of Nigeria, and they are not aggressively prosecuted by the Nigerian government</p>
        </li> 
        </ul>
