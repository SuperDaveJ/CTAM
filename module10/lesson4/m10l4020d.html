        <br />When analyzing a problem, you are usually an “observer”-you don’t have much participation in the issue.  The Red Team Analytic Method transforms you into an “actor” operating within the adversary’s culture and political mindset.<br/><br/>
        This role play is useful when trying to replicate the mind-set of authoritarian leaders, terrorist cells, or other non-Western groups that operate under very different codes of behavior or motivations. It can also be useful when applied to criminal organizations in law enforcement problems.<br/><br/> 
This method also considers new or different information that might not have been factored into your traditional analysis.  This information can include:<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>Familial ties</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>International political</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>Economic</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>Military pressures </p>
</li>
</ul>
For example, a Red Team Analytic Method expert might ask: "What would my peers, family, or tribe expect me to do in this situation?"<br/><br/>
A Red Team Analytic Method expert may also ask his colleagues: "How do we perceive the external threats and opportunities?"<br/><br/> 
Finally, the Red Team Analytic Method can factor into its analysis the way in which personal power and status might influence behavior.<br/><br/>
