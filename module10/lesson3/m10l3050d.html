            <br /><b>Step 1:</b> Outline the mainline judgment and key assumptions<br/><br/>
            It’s easy to fall into the devil’s advocate role without taking time to carefully outline and understand the argument you are challenging. This weakens the analytic method and may not result in as useful an analysis.<br/><br/>
            Take the time to articulate key assumptions and evidence supporting the current analytic line.<br/><br/>
           <b>Step 2:</b> Determine weaknesses in this argument<br/><br/>
           To look for weaknesses in the argument, take time to select assumptions susceptible to challenge. Look for assumptions based on personal biases or those that might be outdated. Review the information for validity, deception, and major gaps. Determine if the analytic line is based on sources of questionable authority or if the data could be deceptive. Consider whether the absence of evidence could undercut some of the conclusions and look for major gaps in the available evidence.<br/><br/>
           <b>Step 3:</b> Assess your argument and present findings that demonstrate weaknesses<br/><br/>
          You should assess your argument and identify points which can lead to weaknesses in it. This is an important step and requires you to apply critical thinking skills you learned in this course.<br/><br/>
          While this can involve some analytic time and effort, when you have worked on an issue for a long period of time, it is probably wise to assume that you have developed a strong mindset and that mindset deserves the closer scrutiny provided by the advocate for the analytic method.<br/>
          <br/>
           <b>Step 4:</b> If appropriate, draft a separate contrarian paper<br/><br/>
           Drafting a separate contrarian paper helps you assess your argument to uncover weaknesses. This step is probably necessary if your analysis uncovers major analytic flaws.<br/><br/>
           This separate analytic product should lay out all the arguments and data that support a contrary hypothesis. This way, you can see your analysis and compare its findings so you can assess the validity of your findings.<br/><br/>
           Here’s a tip. Make sure you define it specifically as a "Devil’s Advocacy" project, so that you can keep track of your findings easier!</span></td>
