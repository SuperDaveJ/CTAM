    This graphic initially shows an intelligence analyst sitting at his desk. When it is selected, the following text is overlaid on top of the graphic:<br>
    <br>Drs. Paul and Elder describe uncritical thinkers below:<br>"The overwhelming preponderance of people have not freely decided what to believe, but, rather, have been socially conditioned into their beliefs. Their personal beliefs are often based on prejudices.and largely based on stereotypes, caricatures, oversimplifications, sweeping generalizations. Their views are largely constructed from social forces they do not perceive or understand. They want all problems to admit to a simple solution and one they are familiar with. The mass media are structured to appeal to such persons." - Drs. Richard Paul and Linda Elder, The Thinker's Guide to Fallacies, Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2004</span></td>
