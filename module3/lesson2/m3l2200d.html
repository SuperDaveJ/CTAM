        <br />There are two images on this page:<br><br>The first graphic is the image of cover of the 2006 book The Thinker's Guide to Fallacies: The Art of Mental Trickery and Manipulation by Drs. Paul and Elder, with the following text overlaid: "There is a smaller group skilled in the art of manipulation and control. They have greater command of rhetoric and persuasion, and know how to use the established structure of power to advance their interests. They are careful to present themselves as sharing the values of those they manipulate." The Thinker's Guide to Fallacies: The Art of Mental Trickery and Manipulation by Drs. Richard Paul and Linda Elder, Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2006<br><br>
        The second graphic is the image of a notepad, with the following text overlaid: "To manage or utilize skillfully and to control or play upon by artful, unfair, or insidious means especially to one's own advantage".<br>
        Skilled Manipulators can use artful, unfair or other means to get others to see things their way.
