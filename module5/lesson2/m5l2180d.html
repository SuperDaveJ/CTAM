    Background image of a book overlaid with the following quote:<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Quantity of ideas eventually leads to quality.  This is based on the assumption that the first ideas that come to mind will be those that are most common or usual. It is necessary to run through these conventional ideas before arriving at original or different ones. People have habitual ways of thinking, ways that they continue to use because they have seemed successful in the past. It may well be that these habitual responses, the ones that come first to mind, are the best responses and that further search is unnecessary.  In looking for usable new ideas, however, one should seek to generate as many ideas as possible before evaluating them.&rdquo;<br>
