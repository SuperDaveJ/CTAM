    Questions are an important tool to ensure that you get focused and accurate information and that you come to the right conclusions. Take a minute to see what some expert critical thinkers have to say about the importance of questions.<br>
    <br>    
    From <em>The Role of Questions in Teaching, Thinking, and Learning</em>:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>Thinking is not driven by answers but by questions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>Questions define tasks, express problems and delineate issues. Answers often signal a full stop in thought. Only when an answer generates a further question does thought continue its life as such.</p>
	</li>
    </ul>
	From  Critical Thinking and Intelligence Analysis by David T. Moore:<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Questions provide a formal means by which an analyst confronts biases about likely outcomes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Questions serve to alert analysts to the notion that they might be deceived.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
	  Drs. Paul and Elder state that questions guide your thinking, and if the question is vague, your thinking will lack clarity.
