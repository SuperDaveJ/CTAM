        Remember the Elements of Thought, which you learned about in Module 4? Well, now you&rsquo;ll apply these to analyzing your data. Take a minute to see how each element of thought can help you ensure the most effective analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose of Thinking:</strong> Your purpose is your goal, your objective, and what you are trying to say or accomplish. This term also includes functions, motives and intentions. You should be clear about your purpose and goal, and you should be able to justify your purpose.</p>
      <p><strong>Question at Issue:</strong> The question creates the framework about the issue and guides your thinking.  When a question is not understood, you cannot think clearly about it, and clarity is missing.  The question should be clear enough to easily guide your thinking.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Evidence:</strong> In your job, you have access to a wide variety of data sets.  But the amount of data you can bring to bear on any issue can be overwhelming!   Before reviewing your data, you need to ask yourself some tough questions to narrow down your research and ensure you use only the most relevant and useful data. You don&rsquo;t want to waste time tracking down data that doesn&rsquo;t really help your analysis.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Interpretation and Inference:</strong> Inferences are interpretations and conclusions you arrive at based on your review of the data.  You actually begin making inferences the moment you start collecting data and continue until you think you have enough to answer your question.<br>
        <br>
        The challenge for inferences is to make sure you are conscious of them so that you can check them and ensure that they are supported.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Concepts:</strong> Drs. Paul and Elder define concepts as:<br>
        <br>
&ldquo;Ideas, theories, laws, principles or hypotheses we use in thinking to make sense of things.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      As you begin to apply concepts to your data, remember to be clear about them and use them wisely. Sometimes our concepts may be twisted. We use self-serving ways to manipulate or to pursue our own agendas.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Assumptions:</strong> You also need to be clear about any assumptions you are making as you review your data and create your concepts. Consciously write down every assumption you have about the data. Then ask yourself some tough questions to be sure those assumptions are valid.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Implications and Consequences:</strong> Drs. Paul and Elder stated that thinking through your implications prior to taking any action on them requires you to have the ability to think on various levels.  Remember the old phrase for every action there is an equal reaction?   Remember this when thinking critically so that you consider all the consequences of your conclusions.<br>
        <br>
        In strategic analysis, policymakers may want you to state implications or limit yourself to conclusions, leaving implications to superiors.  Find out which your policy maker prefers!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Point of View:</strong> You should also be aware of what your point of view is when applying concepts to data.  Your point of view can easily distort the way you see things.  Understanding your limitations in this and looking fully at all other viewpoints can resolve this problem.<br>
        <br>
      Be especially sure to check viewpoints you don&rsquo;t agree with. Often, people refuse to consider those viewpoints, probably because they&rsquo;re afraid that by considering them, they may have to change their own viewpoint, belief, or goal.</p></td>
