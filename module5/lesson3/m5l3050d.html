        <br />        
        The process for generating hypotheses consists of four steps. Let&rsquo;s see how we can apply that process to an example. Suppose you learned that the officer in charge at the border has observed that more lower-level criminal offenders are arrested at the border than higher-level offenders. Let&rsquo;s generate a hypothesis about why that is happening.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Step 1. Identify the major problem.</strong><br>
      <br>
      First, you need to clearly state the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve. In the intelligence world, this is called framing the question, which you learned about earlier. <br>
      <br>
      As you think more deeply about the issue of the border arrests, you ask specific questions to put parameters around what you are being asked to analyze.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, you have an observation about the numbers of arrests at the border. There certainly seems to be a pattern to these arrests. You are being asked to determine what that pattern might mean.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 2. Make an educated guess</strong><br>
      <br>
      Second, you review the data and make an educated guess about what you think is going on. At this point, you may actually have several guesses. <br>
      <br>
      For example, the observation about border arrests could mean that:<ul>
        <li>
          <p>Higher-level criminals are better at not getting caught</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There are more lower-level criminals crossing the border than higher-level criminals.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Border agents are targeting lower-level criminals.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Higher-level criminals are not participating in crimes across the border.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
		<strong>Step 3. Identify the major variables</strong><br>
		<br>
    In our example, some of the variables are:
	<ul>
        <li>
          <p>Number of higher-level criminals arrested at the border</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Number of lower-level criminals arrested at the border</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Number of arrests in general at the border</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The border agent&rsquo;s observations</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
	   <strong>Step 4. Write a simple, declarative statement</strong><br>
      Finally, write a simple, declarative statement. Do not use the words &ldquo;I think&rdquo; at the beginning of the sentence.<br>
      <br>
      For the border arrest example, you&rsquo;d need to review the available data to determine which of the hypotheses you generated is most likely. Suppose, for example, that the data you analyzed pointed strongly to a conclusion that higher-level criminals are not participating in crimes across the border. That is your hypothesis.	</td>
