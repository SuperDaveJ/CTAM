    A famous psychology experiment is about a video of a car accident. After the video, watchers were separated into groups and asked the same question about the accident. Only one word was changed in the question. &ldquo;How fast were the cars going when they&hellip;&rdquo;
	<ul>
	<li><p>Smashed…41mph</p></li>
	<li><p>Collided&hellip;39mph</p></li>
	<li><p>Bumped&hellip;38mph</p></li>
	<li><p>Hit&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;34mph</p></li>
	<li><p>Contacted&hellip;32mph</p></li>
	</ul>
    One week later, the experimenters asked if there was broken glass by the scene of the accident. People from the &ldquo;smashed&rdquo; group reported seeing glass more often than other groups. Nineteen percent of all people reported seeing broken glass. <br>
    <br>
    There was no broken glass anywhere in the video of the accident. The researchers were able to manipulate the way information was encoded in the peoples&rsquo; brains, just by changing one word. Their memories of the events were not objective.
