      <strong><br>
    Example of Memory Retrieval:</strong> Elizabeth Loftus, a USC professor, did a series of experiments with reconstructed memories. Family members were &ldquo;in&rdquo; on experiment and lied to a sibling about a childhood event. For example, they told the sibling about the time he fell off a pier and into a lake. Everything about the story was true except for this incident. Two weeks later that sibling is brought back, and amazingly, he was able to recall this memory. Not only did he remember it, but even added details to the story.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Conclusion from the Example:</strong> The point is that memory, like perception, is not a perfect representation of the information. As information is processed and enters your memory system, your perspectives can be shaped in ways that are different from other people&rsquo;s perspectives. This is normal, but you must be aware of the tendency to ensure your reporting is as accurate as possible.</td>
