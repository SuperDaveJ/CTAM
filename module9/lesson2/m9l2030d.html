    An easy way to think of this is the day after the big game.  Your colleagues may sit around for hours dissecting what happened.  Fans for the team on the losing end might discuss certain things that, if they happened, would have changed the outcome of the game.  This is also referred to as Monday Morning Quarterbacking, but it is also hindsight bias.<br>
    <br>
    The Challenger disaster is another good example to look at.  In hindsight, it seems impossible that NASA would allow the shuttle to launch, knowing the temperature was so much lower than any previous launch.  In retrospect, frozen O-rings were an unacceptable risk. </td>
