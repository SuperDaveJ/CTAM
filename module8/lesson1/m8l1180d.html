                  <p><strong>Increased number of police officers:</strong> In an article titled, “Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not,” University of Chicago economist Stephen Levitt (bio) said that adding police officers did less to stem the rising tide of crime than did the legalization of abortion: “Unwantedness leads to high crime. Abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”<BR>
                    <BR>Regardless of your stance on this controversial issue, Levitt took a cause-effect issue (police and crime) and proposed a completely different theory for how the two are related.<br><br><strong>Steven David Levitt's Bio</strong><br><br>Steven David "Steve" Levitt is an American economist known for his work in the field of crime. He is the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, director of the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
