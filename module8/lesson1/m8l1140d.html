                  Heuer says the expected similarity of cause and effect helps explain the persuasiveness of conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories are invoked to explain large effects for which there do not otherwise appear to be correspondingly large causes. For example, it seems “...outrageous that a single, pathetic, weak figure like Lee Harvey Oswald should alter world history.”</p>

                  Al-Qaeda reportedly spent between $100 and $500K on the September 11 attacks. How much damage did it cost?
