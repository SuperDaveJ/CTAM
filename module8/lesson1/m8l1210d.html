          Here's an example of anchoring. Researchers asked students to spin a roulette wheel. The students did not know that the wheel was rigged so the ball would land only on 10 or 65. After their spin, the students were asked to guess the number of African nations in the UN. How do you think the roulette wheel roll affected their estimates? <br>
          <br>
		  Students who rolled the high number of 65 overestimated the number of African nations at 45%.            
          </p>
          <p>Students who rolled the low number of 10 underestimated the number of African nations at 25%.<br>
              <br>
            These are remarkable results!  If one roll of a roulette wheel can influence your thinking without you even knowing it, how much stronger is a series of analytic reports or several years of experience on patrolling the border?
