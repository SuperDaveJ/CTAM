                  <p>Photo of notepad with text written on it and text title that says: “Initial estimate from previous experience.” The audio for this visual says: An analyst has an initial estimate as a starting point, perhaps from a previous analysis of the same subject or from some other partial calculation.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Animation shows an arrow going from the initial estimate to the first approximation and text title that says: “First approximation.” The audio for this animation says: The analyst then uses this starting point as the first approximation to the desired judgment, rather than starting from scratch.</p>
                </li>
				
				<li><p>Animation shows an arrow going from the first approximation back to the starting point with text title: “Adjust starting point.” The audio for this animation says: Based on the results of additional information or analysis, the analyst then adjusts the starting point.</p>
                </li>
				
				<li><p>The graphic shows a grayed-out box titled: “Starting from scratch is much more desirable than starting at the initial starting point.” The audio for this graphic says: Because the adjustment is anchored to the original estimate, it doesn’t move as much as it should.</p>
