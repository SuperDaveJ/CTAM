            <br /><strong>Statistics:</strong> “Statistical data, in particular, lack the rich and concrete detail to evoke vivid images, and as a result, they are often overlooked, ignored, or minimized” – Richards J. Heuer<br><br>Most people are more impacted by images rather than statistics.  The numbers just aren’t as vivid as an image, so they don’t stick in people’s minds. <br><br><strong>Images:</strong> Information that is vivid, concrete, and personal has a greater impact on your thinking than abstract information. Images are more vivid than statistics so they make a stronger impression on our memory.<br><br>It’s important to remember that people are emotional creatures. The role emotions play in our decision making is vastly underrated, if not dismissed.<br><br><strong>First-Hand Account:</strong> Imagine if your best friend or a close relative lost someone in 9/11, and you had to help that person recover from the tragedy. You would learn about terrorism first hand. How might that change your perceptions of terrorism?<br><br>What people see or they hear with their own ears or see with their own eyes is likely to have greater impact than information received secondhand that may have greater evidential value.</td>
