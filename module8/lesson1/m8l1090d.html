                  <p> You may expect some patterns to be similar when they’re not; for example: big things have big causes and small things do not. </p>

<li>Settle for the first solution that makes sense<br>
People have a tendency to pick the first solution that makes sense to them, and then stick with that solution.<br />

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Your mind can get stuck, or anchored to, your first hypothesis.

                  <p>
                    Your thinking may be influenced more by information that is vivid, concrete, and personal versus abstract information.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    You may be more likely to believe what you see with your own eyes than second-hand information that may have greater evidential value.

                </li>

<li>Unconsciously put stock in evidence that supports your beliefs and disregard evidence that does not<BR><BR>
We may think that we gather data and then make decisions, but all too often, we do that in reverse. We make our decision and then look for the data that supports it.<br />

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>You subconsciously find evidence that supports your original hypothesis even when you have overwhelming evidence that says you are wrong.</p>
                </li>		              
			  </ul>
</li><li>Perceive what you expect to perceive<br>
What we think we are viewing objectively often has a very subjective slant to it because we perceive what we want to perceive and tune out the rest.
