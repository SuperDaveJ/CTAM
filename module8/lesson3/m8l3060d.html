            <br />Here’s an example related to your work as an analyst:<br> 
Richards J. Heuer reports that during the 1978-1979 Egypt-Israel peace negotiations, each party attributed had very different perspectives on signing the treaty and on each other’s past behavior. Compare each country’s perspectives. <br><br>

What Israel believed:


			<ul>
                <li>
                  <p> Egypt’s willingness to make peace resulted from a deteriorating economy and a growing awareness of Israel’s military superiority. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p> Israel’s own willingness to compromise was a sign of their ever-present preference for peace. </p>
                </li>
				<li>
				  <p> Egypt’s undesirable behaviors, such as their past tendency to issue threats of annihilation, were a result of Egypt’s inherent opposition to a Jewish state. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <p> Egypt’s desirable behavior of ceasing threats emanated from external circumstances, such as Israel's relative military superiority. </p>
				</li>
            </ul>
			
What Egypt believed:

<ul>
                <li>
                  <p> Israel’s willingness to make peace resulted from external pressures, such as positive inducements and threats of negative sanctions by U.S. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p> Egypt’s own willingness to sign a treaty was due to their inherent disposition for peace.  However, </p>
                </li>
				<li>
				  <p> Israel’s establishment of settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan River was because of Zionist expansionism. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <p>
				    If Israel chose not to place settlements, that was because of external constraints, such as Western condemnation of settlements.  
			      </p>
				</li>
				
            </ul>
