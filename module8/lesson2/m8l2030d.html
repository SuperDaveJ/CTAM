            <br />Let’s take a look at some examples of this cognitive error.<br><br>1. Yom Kippur War<br>
In 1973, intelligence analysts were convinced that the build-up of forces in Israel was merely a military exercise, not mobilization for war.<br><br>On October 6, 1973, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger received an assessment indicating that the war between Egypt and Israel was unlikely—just hours after he had learned from other sources that the so-called Yom Kippur War was under way.<br><br>George and Bruce say that this example is one of the CIA’s most bureaucratically embarrassing intelligence failures.<br><br>2. Berlin Wall<br>
George and Bruce reveal that the more expertise analysts had with the Soviets, the less likely they were to believe the Wall would fall.<br><br>In <em>Analyzing Intelligence</em>, George and Bruce reveal that the more expertise analysts had with the Soviets, the less likely they were to believe the Wall would fall. <br><br>George and Bruce describe this embarrassing mistake for the Intelligence Community: “On November 9, 1989, while CIA experts on Soviet and East German politics were briefing President H.W. Bush on why the Berlin Wall was not likely to come down any time soon, a National Security Council staff member politely entered the Oval Office and urged the President to turn on his television set—to see both East and West Germans battering away at the Wall.” <em>Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles and Innovations</em>, 2008</td>
