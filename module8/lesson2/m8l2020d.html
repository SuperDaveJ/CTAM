            <br />This animation shows an image of an expert on the left with the following text below it: <br>
            Well-developed mindsets help experts assess and anticipate normal developments; <br>
            <br>At the right, an image of an expert is shown with the following text below it:<br>
Difficulty in accepting still inconclusive evidence of what they believe to be unlikely and exceptional developments. <br>
<br>
In between the two images is the quote:
“The more analysts are invested in well-developed mindset that helps them assess and anticipate normal developments, the more difficult it is for them to accept still inconclusive evidence of what they believe to be unlikely and exceptional developments.”<br>
