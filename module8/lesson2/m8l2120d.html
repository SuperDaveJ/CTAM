              <br />Read the following article from the February 2009 of the Houston Chronicle and answer the question below. <br><br><strong>Past probes sought to tie Stanford to drugs</strong><br>"Authorities for years have investigated R. Allen Stanford, looking for ties to organized drug cartels and money laundering, going back at least a decade when the Texas billionaire's offshore bank surrendered $3 million in drug money, state and federal sources told the Houston Chronicle Friday. <br>
              <br>
              But no one has ever been able to make a criminal case.<br>
              <br>
              Texas securities officials investigated, as did the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI. But none found solid evidence of a link between drug money and Stanford, who now stands accused of running a multibillion-dollar fraud at his offshore bank in Antigua and Houston-based brokerage firm.<br>
              <br> In the late 1990s, according to court documents, operatives of the Juarez cartel began opening accounts at Stanford's Antigua-based bank in an effort to launder money amassed under one of Mexico's most vicious drug lords, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Together, they used Stanford International Bank to open 10 accounts and deposit $3 million - a small sliver of the cartel's fortunes but enough to pique authorities' interest. <br><br> Suppose you've been assigned to create a finding on the above case of a Texas. From the itemms listed below, determine what evidence you might need.</td></tr><tr>
