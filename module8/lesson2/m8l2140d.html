            <br />The way you use evidence for a criminal investigation is a bit different from how you use it for an intelligence analysis. So, the errors you have to guard against are a bit different. Take a moment to compare the two. 
			<br><br> <strong>Criminal Investigation</strong><br>
In criminal investigation, rather than attempting to prove an abstract or hypothetical point, you attempt to determine who is responsible for a criminal act. Your aim is to try to connect physical evidence and reports of witnesses to a specific person. While this is supposedly a non-biased act, investigators can sometimes have agendas of their own.

<br><br> <strong>Intelligence Analysis</strong><br>
In intelligence, you are trying to prove or disprove a hypothetical point. You are looking beyond who is involved, but looking at motivations, actions, timelines, physical evidence, etc. You look at and test everything in order to reach your finding or conclusion. Therefore, everything you look at must be accurate, supportable and free from error.
